# Plan next steps

## Step 1

The log files in arrow format must be written into the output folder. Create an output folder relative to the repo root if it does not exist. Add this folder to .gitignore

As file name for the log files the field log_file defined in settings_xxx.yaml shall be used.

## Step 2

Configure Revise such that it revises structs.

Enabling struct revision

On Julia 1.12+, Revise can automatically revise struct definitions in a running session. This feature requires scanning the global method table and type hierarchy at startup, which can be slow so it's disabled by default. If you would like to enable it you can set the revise_structs preference to true via Preferences.jl.

Add the following to the LocalPreferences.toml file in your active project:

[Revise]
revise_structs = true
